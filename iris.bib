	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Ambient assisted living (AAL) is focused on providing assistance to people primarily in their natural environment. Over the past decade, the AAL domain has evolved at a fast pace in various directions. The stakeholders of AAL are not only limited to patients, but also include their relatives, social services, health workers, and care agencies. In fact, AAL aims at increasing the life quality of patients, their relatives and the health care providers with a holistic approach. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the AAL domain, presenting a systematic analysis of over 10 years of relevant literature focusing on the stakeholders’ needs, bridging the gap of existing reviews which focused on technologies. The findings of this review clearly show that until now the AAL domain neglects the view of the entire AAL ecosystem. Furthermore, the proposed solutions seem to be tailored more on the basis of the available existing technologies, rather than supporting the various stakeholders’ needs. Another major lack that this review is pointing out is a missing adequate evaluation of the various solutions. Finally, it seems that, as the domain of AAL is pretty new, it is still in its incubation phase. Thus, this review calls for moving the AAL domain to a more mature phase with respect to the research approaches},

	abstract = {The number of proposals involving ICT-based intelligent solutions for the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is continuously increasing. Thus, tests and a validation process are crucial for implementing effective systems. However, testing and validating software systems for the AAL in real environments are onerous and safety-critical tasks. Problems often arise when the software is being installed in a real smart home: unpredicted scenarios can occur, thus forcing the designer to perform complex fixing when it is too late. This paper proposes the adoption of a 3D simulator to speed up the development and testing phases of software for AAL systems, by restricting possible issues occurring during the tests in real scenarios. The paper describes the architecture of the simulator and the implemented virtual environment. Moreover, it presents a use case, highlighting how the simulator allows decoupling the software to manage a smart home from the hardware components},

In addition to describing three possible implementations of the touchless interface, the paper provides two contributions: a comparison of two different technologies used as the interface inputs, and the results from 10 preliminary user tests performed to measure the perceived usability. The results are promising: two implementations out of three got an average score around 84 on the "Usability Metrics for User Experience"},

	abstract = {Robots interacting with human beings are widespread in modern environments, and those performing intelligent tasks without human supervision need to take into account potential criticalities. Making robots compete enable their evaluation with respect to navigation, mapping, object recognition, tracking and manipulation capabilities. Robot competitions date back to the early '80s proving to be useful for educational and research purposes. Several competitions are focused on human-robot interaction, even though they rarely produce as outcome robots capable to seamlessly interact with human beings. The main reason for this is the lack of understanding of human intentions and the failure to rapidly react to human actions. In other words, an ideal robot must be able to communicate and coordinate with humans or with other robots, to act autonomously, and to react under real-Time constraints. This paper proposes a new framework to simplify the development of intelligent robots, testing them in a real robot competition. The framework combines (i) a multi-Agent system to interact with humans, other robots and perform object identification and pathfinding, and (ii) a real-Time motion control deployed on the Erika RTOS, to move the robot and react in a timely fashion to changes in the environment. In the considered competition scenario, the robot is required to identify and collect common objects in a bounded arena with dynamic obstacles in a limited amount of time, receiving commands from humans and competing with other robots. This approach confirms the powerful combination of multi-Agent systems, computer vision, and real-Time systems.},

	abstract = {One of the key challenges in the healthcare sector is to adapt Health Information Systems to requirements coming from changing societies. In recent years, governments and international healthcare organizations defined a series of requirements for new generation Health Information Systems: they have to preserve past investments on legacy systems, but must also integrate new technologies, include the patient among their users, and ensure that clinical information are available at all times, even in places far from where information are physically stored. This paper proposes a multi agent-oriented architecture for Health Information Systems, which uses international standards for communication and management of clinical documents. The architecture tries to effectively model a generic healthcare organization, and aims at being easily extensible and adaptable to the particularities of specific healthcare systems. The authors present two experimental scenarios to test the proposed multi-agent health information system. In the first, they show how to model a specific use case, a radiology workflow, using agents and well-known standards; in the second one the authors demonstrate how a mobile application can use the services provided by the agents to support the medical staff in an emergency situation.},

A combination of Artificial Intelligence and NetMedicine could be ideal to face these challenges: they provide the means to develop an intelligent system and simultaneously to distribute it over a network, allowing the communication over the internet, if needed. Hence, the authors present a Multi-Agent Architecture for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL): it is the model for a system to manage a distributed sensor network composed by ambient and biometric sensors. The system should analyse data and pro-active ly decide to trigger alarms if anomalies are detected.

To cope with these problems, this paper presents a publicly available awareness game called Smart Tales, whose goal is to enhance the familiarity of its players with the notion and core concepts of AAL. In Smart Tales, the player has the role of an assisted patient in a smart home, and gets to learn about AAL and its technologies while trying to cheat the sensors that are placed in the house. In addition to presenting the design of the game following the Serious Games Design Assessment framework from the literature, we present results on engagement and learning that we obtained through a formative evaluation with ten users.},

Even if these techniques are well-established and used in commercial robots, different and better sensors are now widespread, such as depth sensors. This work proposes an algorithm based on the use of an active 3D depth sensor for obstacle detection and avoidance. The algorithm, conceived to be used in embedded systems with low processing power, underwent several experiments and proved to be robust to Gaussian white noise.},

	abstract = {A shift in the distribution of population towards older ages is occurring in almost every country of the world and it is becoming a major problem in Europe, Japan and USA, due to the high dependency ratio of these countries. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and Ambient Intelligence (AmI) are polarising the attention of the research community, trying to improve the quality of life of elderly people promoting their autonomy, self-confidence and mobility. Artificial Intelligence (AI), developing intelligent and adaptable systems, can play a considerable role in AAL and AmI to cope with the changing needs that characterize the life of people with chronic diseases. To show a possible contribution of AI in these fields, this paper introduces the multi-agent architecture of an expert system for Ambient Assisted Living: the Virtual Carer (VC). Based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) paradigm, it models the behaviours of a human caregiver. The main goal of the Virtual Carer is to help an elderly patient in his daily activities, while his health conditions are monitored, in order to ensure his security. To show the main capabilities of the system, the paper describes some simulations of the proposed agency, highlighting the architecture of the reasoning component.},

Unfortunately, testing solutions for “Active Assisted Living” in a domotic house requires an enormous effort in terms of work, time and money, especially because we’d need to test them with real inhabitants.  Therefore we developed a 3D simulator for AAL, with the goal to model different virtual scenarios, controlled in an autonomous way by a virtual caregiver able to take decisions from information received from the sensors/inhabitants, and able to return an output in the form of services. The interface with the simulator is provided by a mobile application, while the built-in sensors of the smartphone make it an element that integrates the simulated environment.},

Face recognition is one of these biometric techniques, having its greater advantage in requiring a limited interaction by user.

Each network is associated to an a-priori reliability value for each identity stored in database, modelling the specific skill of the modules composing the system with the recognition of a given subject. Every time a network is in conflict with the global response, it is forced to retrain itself, subjecting the system to a continuous learning. The main goal of this work is to carry out some preliminary tests to evaluate accuracy and robustness of FRS with “subject-dependent” reliability values, when some changes can affect the considered features.

	abstract = {The Western World has almost completed the transition toward the Digital Television (DTV), and in particular toward the Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT). In every home there is at least one decoder for the DTT. Some of them have a modem, to connect to a telephonic return line, and a Smart Card reader, both required by the “Pay TV” channels. Since those readers are compatible with the Governmental Smart Cards, a new access for the masses to secure and confidential digital services is nowadays available in our Information Society. “T-Government” defines the set of services provided by Governments or private entities via DTT. “Multimedia Home Platform” is the standard for DTT applications. A Local Health will be no more justified for offering services only through the Web disregarding both the broadcast and the return channels of the DTT since by doing so it would contribute to deepen the “digital divide” between skilled (young) people and unskilled (elder) people. The author defines a scenario for providing such T-Health Services both for patients (T-monitoring health parameters) and healthy citizens. These latter will have a bunch of services over DTT, not only informative or interactive applications on the Set top Box, but also transactional services through the secure return channel. However, much effort has to be spent to guarantee the usability of that new interface which is quite different from that of a Web application. The author designed, tested and redesigned a suite of DTT applications as a “proof of concept” to show the potential of this new platform for health information services. DTT may represent a real contribution to bring social healthcare and wellness.},

The belief revision approach is not the only possible approach to maintain consistency during evolution: an ontology reengineering can rationally prefer to discard incoming information, or to refine the nature of conflicting implication axioms to derive meaningful answer from inconsistent ontology using paraconsistent logic.},

	booktitle = {Proceedings ELMAR-2012},
	abstract = {Surveillance systems frequently use fixed or semimobile cameras. However, in many cases, the use of intelligent mobile sensors is preferrable over fixed sensors, because the system configuration can be modified according to particular environmental conditions or adapted to compensate for one or more malfunctioning sensors. This paper proposes a real-time surveillance system based on a mobile sensor. Using an Android smartphone and a face-tracking algorithm, the system can move autonomously to track the human face with the longest presence in the video field. In addition, the system can be connected to a computer performing face-recognition through a wireless connection provided by the smartphone. This way the mobile sensor can track a determined human face. The paper provides some experimental results to validate system performance.},

	abstract = {Testing is a key step in the software development cycle. Errors and bug fixing costs can significantly affect development costs without a full and comprehensive test on the system. Testing is even more important in real-time systems, because they are used in environments where a single failure could lead to serious damages. The first efforts to change the Linux kernel, introducing in it some real-time features, are dating back more than ten years ago. Nevertheless, up to now there's not a comprehensive test suite able to assesses the functionality and the conformance to the real-time operating systems standards for the Linux kernel and for the real-time nanokernels that rely on it. This paper discusses an ongoing work on Lachesis, an automated test suite for real-time Linux features. Lachesis's main goals are: to provide a standard and simple API to develop new tests; to provide a set of functional, regression, performance and stress test, either developing or porting them from other test suites; to design and experiment a series of build tests; to make the test suite extensible and portable. Up to now Lachesis is used to test Linux, PREEMPT RT, RTAI and Xenomai real-time features and performances. It provides some tests for SCHED DEADLINE patch, too. Lachesis is under active development: extensions to other real-time systems and more tests are planned to be added in the near future},

Il web, grazie alla sua natura ipermediale sovranazionale è diventato “Il" luogo per eccellenza dove posizionare l'offerta turistica, non solo in quanto vetrina di prodotti ma anche come strumento d'erogazione di servizi transattivi. La Riviera delle Palme attrae da sempre turisti stranieri, ed i suoi operatori sono ogni giorno più attenti all’uso del web, ma la nostra sensazione era che la promozione rimanesse molto legata al passaparola ed alla fidelizzazione affettivo/familiare. Abbiamo quindi inteso effettuare un'analisi per valutare come si stia attrezzando la Riviera al cambiamento epocale in atto, confrontando il posizionamento su Internet della sua offerta turistica con quello della più importante riviera romagnola. Dal confronto nascono alcuni consigli su come far risalire le posizioni dei siti piceni piuttosto “sepolti" nei motori di ricerca: creazione di portali di categoria, innovazione siti esistenti, internazionalizzazione dei contenuti, cross-referencing e aggiornamento continuo.},

One of these is Liver Radiofrequency Ablation. This technique consists in a needle insertion inside the liver parenchyma in order to reach the tumor and in an injection of a radiofrequency current to cause tumor cell necrosis for hyperthermia. The needle placement task is really difficult because surgeon uses ultrasound, CT or MRI two-dimensional image to guide the needle. In this paper we present an Augmented Reality system to help the surgeon to place the needle as best as possible; the application can also help the surgeon during the preoperative planning because it offers various visualization modality of 3D models of the patient's organs obtained from the medical images},

	abstract = {Although Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents have been deeply investigated from both a theoretical and a pragmatic perspective, less attention has been paid to the inherent recursive structure of mental states, which plays an essential role when modelling high level interaction between intelligent agents. This paper tries to capture this property by introducing a multi-context approach to the representation of mental states. A semantics for multi-context formalisms is provided based on the definition of “mental structure”, which is a hierarchical lattice of triangular modules <x,B,D>, where the component x represents the agent x’s mental state as a whole, while B and D represent specifically x’s beliefs and x’s desires. If other mental attitudes, as intention and commitment, are to be considers as primitives, then they can be embodied in the basic module, otherwise they can be represented in terms of beliefs and desires. The old notion of clause is rediscovered in order to facilitate the heavy automated theorem-proving necessary to exploit the potentiality of the formalism for the intelligent interaction with the external environment. The main advantages of this approach are the support for “unconsciousness” and the fact that inferences themselves can be modelled as mental attitudes. Some advanced dynamics of mental states, as the abductive revision of mental states after the reception of a communication, will easily be applied over this formalism.},

The goal of these tools is twofold. To improve the information retrieval processes and the finding of competencies within the organization in order to establish the conditions for the creation of knowledge and the generation of communities of practice.
This objective cannot be resolved without flexible knowledge representation structured as associative networks, which are capable to define user models, i.e. representations of their knowledge, their competencies and their objectives.
But this subsymbolic representation must be formalized to optimize the search of information. We think that, for knowledge management purposes, the better way is to reify the employees’ conceptualizations of the read documents. The obtained representations of the knowledge acquired every day by the workers can be further improved by the use of existing ontologies.
We provide some example of researches performed with the aid of these representations}

The great flexibility of the MPEG-7 standard makes especially difficult to compare descriptions coming from heterogeneous sources. To cope with this, the architecture would first obtain "normalized" versions of the audio descriptions using different adaptation techniques. Once in a "normalized" format, descriptions can be then projected into uniform and semantically relevant vector spaces, ready to be processed by a variety of well known computational intelligence techniques. As higher semantic results are then available, these can be exported as interoperable (RDF) annotations about the resource that was originally fed into the system. As novel aspect, through the use and interchange of MPEG-7 descriptions, the framework allows building applications (e.g. classificators) which can provide annotations on distributed audio resource sets.},

	abstract = {Inside the Juror (Hastie 1994) was, in a sense, a point of arrival for research developing formalisms that describe judicial decision making. Meter-based models of various kinds were mature, and even ready for giving way to such models that would concern themselves with the narrative content of the cases at hand, that a court is called to decide upon. Moreover, excessive emphasis was placed on lay factfinders, i.e. on jurors. It is noticeable that as “AI & Law” has become increasingly concerned with evidence in recent years - with efforts coordinated by Nissan & Martino, Zeleznikow, and others-the baggage of the meter-based models from jury research does not appear to be exploited. In this article, we try to combine their tradition with a technique of belief revision from artificial intelligence, in an attempt to provide an architectural component that would be complementary to models that apply representations or reasoning to legal narrative content.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a distributed approach to belief revision is presented. It is conceived as a collective activity of a group of interacting agents, in which each component contributes with its own local beliefs. The integration of the different opinions is performed not by an external supervisor, but by the entire group through an election mechanism. Each agent exchanges information with the other components and uses a local belief revision mechanism to maintain its cognitive state consistent. We propose a model for local belief revision/integration based on what we called: ldquoPrinciple of Recoverability.rdquo Computationally, our way to belief revision consists of three steps acting on the symbolic part of the information, so as to deal with consistency and derivation, and two other steps working with the numerical weight of the information, so as to deal with uncertainty. In order to evaluate and compare the characteristics and performance of the centralized and of the distributed approaches, we made five different experiments simulating a simple society in which each agent is characterized by a degree of competence, communicates with some others, and revise its cognitive state. The results of these experiments are presented in the paper.},

The opinion expressed in this paper is that, to be applied in a multi-sources environment, belief revision has to depart considerably from the original framework. In particular, it has to abandon the fundamental principle of "Priority to the Incoming Information" in preference to what we called the principle of "Recoverability".

	abstract = {Belief revision is a well-researched topic within Artificial Intelligence (AI). We argue that the new model of belief revision as discussed here is suitable for general modelling of judicial decision making, along with the extant approach as known from jury research. The new approach to belief revision is of general interest, whenever attitudes to information are to be simulated within a multi-agent environment with agents holding local beliefs yet by interacting with, and influencing, other agents who are deliberating collectively. The principle of 'priority to the incoming information', as known from AI models of belief revision, is problematic when applied to factfinding by a jury. The present approach incorporates a computable model for local belief revision, such that a principle of recoverability is adopted. By this principle, any previously held belief must belong to the current cognitive state if consistent with it. For the purposes of jury simulation such a model calls for refinement. Yet, we claim, it constitutes a valid basis for an open system where other AI functionalities (or outer stimuli) could attempt to handle other aspects of the deliberation which are more specific to legal narratives, to argumentation in court, and then to the debate among the jurors.},

New information and evidence integrate and corroborate the cognizance of the Court, but other testimonies might cause conflicts. 
In this case, it seems natural that the acquisition of the new evidence should be accompanied by a reduction of the credibility of the conflicting pieces of knowledge.  
If the juror's corpus of evidence is not a flat set of facts but contains rules, finding such conflicts and determining all the sentences involved in the contradictions can be hard. 
In dealing with these ``changes of mind'' we heavily relies on symbolic logic, since as much as it contributed to the history of ``thinking'', logic could as well solve the problem of ``thinking over''.

incorporare il modello dei sensori nella descrizione del sistema, in modo

possono trarre interessanti conclusioni riguardanti la loro attendibilità

Some of the newcoming pieces of information integrate and corroborate the previously held corpus of sentences about the world, but others might cause serious conflicts with the established knowledge. In this case, the eventual acquisition of the new evidence should be accompanied by a partial or total reduction of the credibility of the conflicting pieces of knowledge. If the system's collection of beliefs is not a flat set of facts but contains rules, finding such conflicts and determining all the sentences involved in the contradictions can be hard because knowledge is only partially explicit.},

perchè possa permettermi il lusso di annoiarlo in partenza con un’altra introduzione
sull’Intelligenza Artificiale. Dovrei farlo perchè è in tale contesto che si colloca l’argomento
affrontato in questo articolo: la “revisione delle conoscenze”. Solo mi pare importante
precisare che per “stato cognitivo di un agente”, qui s’intende l’insieme di conoscenze da esso
possedute e rappresentate mediante un opportuno linguaggio formale. In questo senso, anche
un semplice “database relazionale” può costituire uno stato cognitivo, ma l’intero impianto
concettuale della “belief revision” presupporrà stati cognitivi più complessi, in cui solo una
parte delle informazioni contenute saranno esplicitamente rappresentate, rimanendo le altre in
uno stato di potenziale derivabilità mediante opportune regole d’inferenza.
Se l’agente opera in un mondo sufficientemente complesso e dinamico, il suo stato cognitivo è
destinato ad evolvere per via di aggiornamenti, incrementi o perfezionamenti. Nuove
informazioni possono essere percepite direttamente dal mondo esterno o possono essere
comunicate da altri agenti. Nel caso in cui queste nuove informazioni risultino parzialmente o
totalmente incompatibili con quanto già noto, la loro eventuale acquisizione dovrà essere
accompagnata dalla contemporanea ritrattazione di altre conoscenze in cui si crede(va). Un
agente intelligente deve essere capace di gestire razionalmente questi mutamenti del proprio
stato cognitivo.  .......},

	abstract = {In a Multi-Agent Environment, high degrees of interaction require the agents' being able to evchange information using high level languages and communication protocols. Referring to the classical Speech Acts Theory, it seems to us that the idea of predicting the effects of un utterance over the mental state of the addressee is rather optimistic. These effects are not really completely "a-priori" predictable by the speaker. Along with some predicatable main effects there are other unforeseeable effects. These can be seen as the result of some kind of plausible inference, particularly abduction, performed by the hearer himself over the received communication, its own actual mental state and its previous mental image of the speaker's mental state. In this paper we propose and explore the idea that, having heard an utterance, the hearer can use abduction to create or update his mental image of the speaker's mental state. This idea can be seen as a generalization of the concept of "Plan Recognition" to that of "Mental State Recognition" and is useful in man-machine or machine-machine communication.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a distinction between distributed truth maintenance and distributed belief revision. The latter has a more complex conceptualization than the former and it needs the evaluation of special features as the relationship between the informant's reliability and the information's credibility. We point out some criteria to judge the qualities of a distributed belief revision strategy from a global perspective. However, the performances of such a strategy can be estimated only on a simulation basis. The general framework for assumption-based distributed belief revision that we present has been tested on our specific “CLUEDO” multi-agent simulation testbed. The model has been continuously improved during many cycles of modification of the model, simulation, and evaluation of the performances, till the results presented in this paper are achieved},

	abstract = {We’ve examined various thinkable ways in which plan formation, execution, monitoring and replanning could take advantage from Truth Maintenance techniques. The creation of a plan is based on a set of assumptions about the external environment and task goals. The inconsistency of these sets or the falsehood of some among their elements can cause failures both in plan generation or execution. On failure it becomes important to understand which assumptions were responsible for the flaw in order to get a more updated knowledge base or a consistent goal. Consistency restoration, multisensor information integration and updating knowledge bases, all need knowledge revision techniques. In this paper we report some possible schemes for the interleaving between the activities of an Assumption Based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS) and one or more (STRIPS-like) Planners. We distinguish four cases of useful adoption of an ATMS:

    to check and eventually resolve inconsistencies during a single planner planning,

    to update the knowledge base of a single planner from multisensor information integration or on failure during the execution,

    case 1 but in a multi-planner architecture,

    case 2 but in a multi-planner architecture.},

Till now, much emphasis has been given to plan inference. This paper is about goal recognition: having recognised a plan (may be after the entire plan has been performed), try to recognise which can be the actor's reasons for the plan to be performed. If the actor's planner possesses sufficient inferential capabilities, then goal recognition is not a trivial question. This paper shows that, under simple hypotheses on the nature of the planner that guides an actor's behaviour, an observer can recognize the actor's goal by means of a simple clause-based abductive reasoning. Furthermore, the paper shows how goal recognition can be regarded as a useful step in plan inference. This results refer to the prototypical state-based STRIPS planner},
